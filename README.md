b3cnt-floating
==============

b3cnt-floating is a simple and lightweight stacking window manager. It is a fork
of [b3cnt](https://github.com/mytch444/b3cnt) and will have most of the
functions that it has, but will be more like cwm that I have recently come to
both love and hate.

Installation
------------

    $ vim config.h # And change to your liking.
    $ make
    $ make install

If you have some particular request, just send me an e-mail, and I will possibly
do something about it.
    
Bugs
----
 * Not too many, or, at least nothing catastrophic. 
 	If you find one email me at mytchel at openmailbox dot org and tell me what
	it is.
