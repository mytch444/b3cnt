b3cnt-floating
==============
b3cnt-floating is a simple and lightweight stacking window 
manager. 
It is a fork of [b3cnt](https://github.com/mytch444/b3cnt) 
and is fairly similar. but behaves more like cwm. 
								
It supports multiple desktops, multiple monitors (monitor 
hotplugging), key sub-maps (for example M-p p: sends window to 
bottom of stack), click to focus or focus on enter.


Installation
------------

    $ $EDITOR config.h
    $ make
    # make install # To install to /usr/bin/b3cnt-floating

I have no idea what the name means. It's an acronym for
something but I have long since forgotten what.
