#b3cnt

b3cnt is a simple and lightweight stacking window manager quite similar
to cwm but with some differences.

It supports multiple desktops, multiple monitors, key sub-maps (for
example 'M-p p': sends the focused window to bottom of stack), click
to focus.

I have no idea what the name means. It's an acronym for something but
I have long since forgotten what.
