b3cnt-floating
==============
b3cnt-floating is a simple and lightweight stacking window 
manager. 
It is a fork of [b3cnt](https://github.com/mytch444/b3cnt) 
and is fairly similar. but behaves more like cwm. 
								ENDk
It supports multiple desktops, multiple monitors (monitor 
hotplugging), key sub-maps (for example M-p p: sends window to 
bottom of stack),

 * None that I have found.
