b3cnt-floating
==============

b3cnt-floating is a very simple and lightweight stacking window manager. It is a fork of
[b3cnt](https://github.com/mytch444/b3cnt) and will have most of the functions that that
has but will be more like cwm that I have recently come to both love and hate.

It has has desktops that are ordered in a ring. Basically imagine them being frame on a wheel
that steps around when you change left or right, it even has an accompanining animation to make
it look like that is exactly what is happening.

Installation
------------

    $ emacs config.h # And change to your liking.
    $ make
    $ make install

If you have some particular request, just send me an e-mail, and I will possibly do something
about it.
    
Bugs
----
 * Probably many. If you find one email me at mytchel at openmailbox dot org and tell me what it is.
